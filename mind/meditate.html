            <p>Welcome to the Mind Body Minimalism meditate section, where we invite you to embark on a journey of inner
                peace and clarity. Whether you're a seasoned meditator or new to the practice, we have accessible tools and
                instructions such as guided meditations. However, the first question before learning more, let's answer why
                is meditation important.</p>
            <p>On the surface, Meditation can allow for us to quiet our minds. In short bursts meditation may be used like a
                breathing exercise, creating a moment of calm, allowing us to make better judgments everywhere in life. It
                can also be very instrumental in reducing anxiety, stress, and depression (though it is not a substitute for
                medical recommendations from your doctor or healthcare professional).
            <p>However, with enough practice meditation quiets the mind allowing you to gain clearer insights into yourself
                and your life. This enhanced clarity alters how you act and react. As you continue to practice, you can
                achieve deeper mental tranquility. The more serene your mind becomes, the more acute your perceptions grow.
                Consequently, your actions continue to refine at subtler levels, promoting even greater mental stillness.
                This cycle of clarity and calmness is ongoing and inherently transforms your way of living, shedding many
                burdens you previously thought were essential.</p>
