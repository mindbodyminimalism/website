            Whether it's singing in the shower, code in a website, oil on a canvas or words to your novel, the act of creation is a
            fundemental part of what it means to be human. Creativity allows us to express and explore ourselves in ways not always
            available in conversation. Art and creation has been a part of humanity for a long time. Early examples of human art
            date back tens of thousands of years, and they take the form of cave paintings.
