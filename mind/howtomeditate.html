            <h1>MBM Guide to Meditation</h1>
            <p>Remember, meditation is for enjoyment and should not feel like a chore. While it may not immediately solve
                life's challenges, it can provide a clearer mind and a calmer disposition to better tackle them. Embrace
                meditation as a journey of self-discovery and relaxation, not as a quick fix. With consistent practice,
                you'll find it to be a valuable part of your daily routine.</p>
    
            <h2>Guide to Meditation</h2>
            <p>Contrary to the popularization of meditation you do not need to be guided. Guided meditation is certainly an
                excellent place to start however it is not necessary. After building a comfortability with practicing
                meditation we recommend you end your sessions with guided meditation and continue on your own.</p>
    
            <h3>Essentials for Meditation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> A clean setting is preferred, but not essential. Since your eyes will be
                    closed during meditation, your surroundings may vary.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimize Disturbances:</strong> Itâ€™s especially important for beginners to ensure a quiet space.
                    Turn off phone notifications, separate from others who may distract you (including pets), and try to
                    find a place with as little noise as possible. Perhaps enjoy being outside weather permitting.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a Timer:</strong> Crucial for developing self-discipline. Initially, a timer helps maintain
                    focus. Over time, as your practice deepens, the perception of time may change, making the timer less
                    necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Choose a comfortable position. Whether lying, sitting, or standing, comfort is
                    key to maintaining focus and avoiding sleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Address Physical Needs:</strong> Ensure you're not hungry, thirsty, or otherwise physically
                    uncomfortable before starting.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Meditation Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Eyes:</strong> Begin by closing your eyes to reduce visual distractions. Although possible,
                    meditating with open eyes is not recommended for beginners.</li>
                <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Relax your muscles and breathe deeply. Try the 8-4-8 breathing technique
                    (modified 4-7-8 technique) by inhaling for 8 seconds through your nose, hold for 4, and exhaling for 8
                    through your mouth to calm your mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Aim for a state of pure awareness. Focus on simple sensations like your
                    breath, heartbeat, or subtle sounds to clear your mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Don't struggle against your thoughts. Acknowledge them and return to your
                    focus. Trying too hard may cause anxiety.</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Test yourself to find a comfortable meditation length. Gradually increase
                    your time as you become more comfortable.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Try to remain still, but if absolutely necessary, adjust your position to
                    maintain comfort.</li>
                <li><strong>The Quiet:</strong> With practice, you'll start to 'hear' the silence, a profound feeling of
                    stillness and disconnection from the external world.</li>
                <li><strong>Refreshed:</strong> Open your eyes. After meditation, you'll likely feel rejuvenated, often
                    leading to personal insights and motivations.</li>
            </ol>
    
            <p>Aim to meditate at least 5 minutes a day and quickly work your way to 10 minutes. Over time you should
                increase your practice till you can confidently meditate a total of 20 or more minutes a day. This time be
                broken into one or two sessions per day.</p>
