          Welcome to the Mind Body Minimalism sleep section. Quality sleep is the cornerstone of overall well-being, affecting
          every aspect of our physical and mental health. Our recommendations and tools help you establish a soothing bedtime routine
          promoting deeper and more rejuvenating slumber. By revealing your actual sleep patterns, you
          can more quickly identify the sleep you are getting and the sleep you need. Embrace the tranquility of restful sleep
          and unlock the potential for improved focus, mood, and energy throughout your waking hours. Begin improving your sleep
          today and approach each day with a clear mind and renewed energy by following these three important S.E.A. rules:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Schedule: Maintain a consistent sleep schedule. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on
          weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock.
          </p>
        <p>
          2. Enviornment: Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature. Remove any
          electronics in the room if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Avoid: Avoid using electronic devices, eating, drinking (other than water) or exercising within 60 minutes of going
          to sleep.
