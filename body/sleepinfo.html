    Consider creating a bedtime routine such as the one below:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Turn off/charge all electronic devices</li>
    <li>Set your alarm if necessary</li>
    <li>Put away any clutter or items that may cause stress.</li>
    <li>Take a warm shower or bath to relax your muscles or wash your face</li>
    <li>Put on comfortable pajamas.</li>
    <li>Brush your teeth and floss.</li>
    <li>Set out your clothes for the next day.</li>
    <li>Grab a glass of water to keep by your bedside</li>
    <li>Read a book, listen to calming music, practice deep breathing, meditation for relaxation, or practice gratitude by reflecting on positive aspects of your day.</li>
    <li>Go to sleep on time.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Also consider having a morning routine to help create purpose. Creating an effective morning routine can greatly enhance
    your productivity and well-being. Try to avoid checking emails or social media first thing in the morning, as this can
    lead to distraction and stress. Here are some ideas that you might find helpful:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Wake Up Early: Start your day early to make the most of your morning. Waking up at the same time each day can help
      regulate your body's internal clock.</li>
    <li> Hydration: Begin with a glass of water to rehydrate your body after a night's sleep</li>
    <li>Exercise: Engage in some form of physical activity. This could be a brisk walk, yoga, stretching, or a more intense
      workout. Exercise helps to wake up your body and mind.</li>
    <li>Healthy Breakfast: Eat a nutritious breakfast. A good breakfast fuels your body for the day ahead</li>
    <li>Meditation or Mindfulness: Spend a few minutes in meditation or practicing mindfulness. This helps in reducing stress and improving focus.</li>
    <li>Brush your teeth and floss.</li>
    <li>Planning Your Day: Take some time to plan your day. Make a to-do list, setting priorities for the tasks you need to accomplish..</li>
    <li>Reading or Learning: Dedicate a few minutes to reading a book, listening to a podcast, or learning something new.</li>
    <li>Skin Care and Personal Hygiene: A refreshing shower and a consistent skincare routine can make you feel more awake and prepared for the day.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Remember, the key to a successful morning routine is consistency. It may take some experimentation to find the routine
    that works best for you. Once you find it, try to stick to it as closely as possible and consider writing it down so you
    can start each morning checking items off your list giving yourself a feeling of productivity.
