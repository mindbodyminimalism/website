          understand that deciding what to eat can be a daily struggle, so we're
          here to help you streamline the process. Our platform offers
          personalized meal suggestions tailored to your dietary preferences,

          Before using the Meal Plan tool you should first use the Calorie
          Calculator. The Calorie Calculator will determine the number of
          calories that you should target per day. This number will be taken
          into account when using the Meal Planner. The Meal Planner also
          provides you with a grocery list so that you don't have to figure out
          what is needed to cook each suggested meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also understand that cooking and eating is a very personal part of
          our identity as people. If you feel our tool does not fully meet your
          needs, feel free to use our simple cooking philosophy to create your
          own. By clicking the "Cooking" tab above you can learn more about how
          to design meals that are nutritious, delicious and usually cheap.
